/*
 * "use strict" is cool but it detects errors only at runtime.
 *
 * You'd better add a linter tool to detect many (http://eslint.org/docs/rules/)
 * common problems at dev time.
 *
 * We already have one installed in our project. Hit F1 > Run Task > Lint
 *
 * Cool, uh? Even cooler would be integrating it into VSCode.
 *
 * Open `.vscode/settings.json` and enable the ESLint.
 *
 * Now browse our past lessons and notice that ESLint highlights the errors.
 *
 * You can configure the linter via the `.eslintrc` file.
