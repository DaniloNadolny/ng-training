# Angular training

Support files for my hands-on training on JavaScript, TypeScript & Angular.

## Prerequisites
1. Install [Node.js 7](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).
1. Install [MS VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
1. Clone this repo.
1. `npm install`

Then you can start the course by opening this directory in VSCode.

VSCode will ask you to install some recommended extensions. Accept it.

After that, open the first file in the `src` dir.

Have fun!
